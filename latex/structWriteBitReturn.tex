\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A struct representing the return value of the {\ttfamily Read\+Bits} method. 

The {\ttfamily \doxylink{structWriteBitReturn}{Write\+Bit\+Return}} struct contains an array of integers representing the bits that were read, and the number of bits that were read. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
